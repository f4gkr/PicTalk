/**
  In current version the frame is (SymbolRate x Oversample ratio) wide
  This is the DEMODULATOR_SAMPLERATE constant

  For example : Symbol Rate is 9600 , Oversample Ratio = 4
                we have a sampling rate of 38400 Hz
                DEMODULATOR_SAMPLERATE = 38400


  To avoid RX Dc at center and enable energy detction (power based or autocorrelation), we
  shift the subband of interest by FRAME_OFFSET_LOW Hz + DEMODULATOR_SAMPLERATE/2
        example : Offset set at 10 000 Hz
        sub-band is centered at (FRAME_OFFSET_LOW Hz + DEMODULATOR_SAMPLERATE/2)=10 000 + 38400/2
                                                                             = 29200 Hz

  Finally:
    if frequency of interst is f0 :
    - receiver is tuned to f0 -> we have a DC residual
    - we extract a subwindow (using Overalp/save channelizer) of (SymbolRate x Oversample ratio) Hz
    - This subband is not centered at f0, but at f0 - FFAME_OFFSET_LOW Hz + DEMODULATOR_SAMPLERATE/2

  example :
    - want to extract signal Symbol Rate is 9600 , Oversample Ratio = 4, centered at f = 436.500 MHz
    - DEMODULATOR_SAMPLERATE = 38400
    - (FRAME_OFFSET_LOW Hz + DEMODULATOR_SAMPLERATE/2)= 29200 Hz
    - Rx is tuned to f = 436.500 MHz - 29200 Hz ;
    - Channelizer (ddc) is centerd at +(FRAME_OFFSET_LOW Hz + DEMODULATOR_SAMPLERATE/2) = 29200
    - Received bandwidth is DEMODULATOR_SAMPLERATE = 38400
