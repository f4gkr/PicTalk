+ rolling back decodeZ3.py to working version
+ RTLSDR : fixed ppm error processing when value < 0
+ display text content (printable chars) when a frame is received
+ Specific feature for the PicSat team: disable the SiDS upload if user callsign is NOSIDS (capital letters)

27/02/2018
+ new colormaps for the waterfall with selection
+ Added user preferences save into pictalk.conf, now saving Threshold, FFT Refresh rate and Gain settings.
  The gain settings value is okay for "single stage SDR" like RTLSDR or SDRPlay where only one knob is
  required. For AirSpy where 3 values are required (LNA, Mix, VGA), this is not working yet.
+ Ongoing efforts to have the python correctly working for Windows, trying to call an external Windows shell
  running Python.exe instead of binding python & the program. Net yet okay !
+ some edits in the files where the licence section was missing

25/02/2018
+ Compiled for SSE2 support by default now - remove section in pictalk.pro
+ AirSpy sample rate changed to 'lowest' instead of 'highest'. For example 2.5 MHz for the "AirSpy one"
+ AirSpy start/stop bug fixed
+ parameters checking : Lat/lon format tested at startup to check that fits with SiDS requirements
+ .pro file : added a section to warn that Qt5 is required
+ Added back the FUNCube support, one user has reported success - not sure that works ! (not convinced @home)
+ Initial low level for the Waterfall adatepted to the device (and its sensitivity)
+ removed a non-ascii char in the Python code
+ added a change log ;-)
